py_stringmatching
=================

This project seeks to build a Python software package that consists of a comprehensive and scalable set of string tokenizers (such as alphabetical tokenizers, whitespace tokenizers) and string similarity measures (such as edit distance, Jaccard, TF/IDF). The package is free, open-source, and BSD-licensed.
